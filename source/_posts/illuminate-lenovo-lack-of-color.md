### Fix 2: Hard reset your Lenovo laptop

 Peripheral devices that are connected to your Lenovo laptop could also be the cause of the black screen issue. If this is the case for you, you may notice that the dots are spinning during the boot-up process. So you should perform a hard reset on your Lenovo laptop to narrow down the possibilities.

Here is how to do it:

1) Turn off your Lenovo laptop.

2) Unplug the power cord, remove the battery, and disconnect all external connected peripheral devices from your laptop.

3) Leave your laptop off for 30 seconds.

4) Press and hold the power button for about 60 seconds.

5) Put your battery back in the laptop and connect the power cord.

6) Turn on your laptop and check if it boots up properly.

* **If it boots up fine** , then congrats – you’re close to finding the culprit (i.e. one of the peripherals). You can then turn off your laptop, and plug in the peripherals one at a time until you can reproduce the black screen.

 If this method fixes your black screen issue, you should [**update your graphics driver**](#F3) to prevent this issue from happening again.

* **If the screen is still black** , the issue isn’t with the peripherals. You should move on to**Fix 3** , below to continue the troubleshooting.

### Fix 4: Restart the explorer.exe process

 Explorer.exe manages the desktop, taskbar, and other processes on your laptop, so if it’s closed in your system, your desktop and taskbar will become invisible and your screen will go black. In this case, you will need to restart the process to see if it solves the problem.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Ctrl** , **Shift,** and **Esc** keys at the same time to open**Task Manager** .

 2) Locate**Windows Explorer** and click**End task** .

 3) Restart your laptop to see if the black screen issue has been eliminated. If it’s still no joy, please move on to**Fix 5** , below.

### Fix 5: Disable fast startup

 Fast startup is a new feature in Windows 10 that enables your computer to boot up faster by saving the operating system state to a hibernation file. However, this does not always work perfectly and it sometimes can mess up with the startup process and cause the screen to go black.

So you can try disabling fast startup to see if it does the trick:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, type **powercfg.cpl** and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-562.png)

 2) Click **Choose what the power buttons do** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-566.png)

 3) Click **Change settings that are currently unavailable** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-567.png)

 4) Un-tick **the box** for **Turn on fast startup (Recommended)** , click **Save changes,** and close the window.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 5) Restart your computer and check if your laptop screen displays properly.

### Fix 6: Perform a system restore

 If this black screen issue occurs only recently when you have made some changes to your computer, such as installing a new program or running a Windows update, chances are these changes are not very compatible with the operating system and trigger the black screen problem. So you should perform a system restore to revert your laptop to a previous state before these changes.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and type**system restore** , then click on**Create a restore point** once it shows up as a matching result.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-571.png)

 2) In the **System Protection** tab, click **System Restore…** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-572.png)

 3) Read the on-screen descriptions about what a system restore will do and will not do and click**Next** to continue.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-573.png)

 3)_Tick_ **the box** for**Show more restore points** and select the **restore point** that you want to use to revert your computer to and click**Next** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-574.png)

 4) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the system restore process.

 5) Restart your computer to see if the black screen issue has been fixed.
