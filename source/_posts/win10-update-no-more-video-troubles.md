![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59bf33c97703a.jpg)

 If you’re on Windows 10 and you find yourself unable to watch or videos on Netflix or YouTube, or that the sound goes ahead whilst the video lags behind, you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting that they are having problems with their video streaming as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix.

 Here are 4 solutions for you to fix. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.
``
`` [**1:** **Upgrade Video Players**](#1)
`` **[2: Disable Hardware Acceleration](#2)**
`` **[3: Update Graphics Driver](#3)**
`` **[4: Clean Browser Cache](#4)**
``

## **1: Upgrade Video Players**

 Upgrade your**Adobe Flash Player** ,**Quick Time player** ,**DivX Web Player** ,**Microsoft Silverlight** etc, if you have them installed on your PC.

 Buggy or faulty installed online video streaming products such as these can be the cause of your video streaming problems. So if you haven’t upgrade your video streaming products to the latest version, do it now.

 Make sure that you have the installed the correct version for your operating system.
``

## **2: Disable Hardware Acceleration**

 In some cases, disabling hardware acceleration and restart your browser later helps to fix such a problem.
``
`` 1) Right-click the**Flash video** that you are watching, and click **Settings** .

## **3: Update Graphics Driver**

 It’s important that your graphics card driver is up-to-date especially when it comes to video streaming issues.

 To do so, you can go to Device Manager or Windows Update and get the latest graphics card driver from Microsoft. The whole process could take some time if you’re not particularly familiar with driver update and install.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
