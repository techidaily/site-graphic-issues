### 1.1 Use the original graphics card driver

 If your screen goes black after you install a graphics card driver, the display card driver itself might be at fault. To see if this is your case, you can try the following to see if the same problem remains with the original graphics card driver from Microsoft. To do the test:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time, then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit**Enter** .

2. Double-click to expand the**Display adapters** category, then right-click your display card and select**Update driver** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-34.png)
3. Select**Browse my computer for drivers** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-35.png)
4. Select**Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-36.png)
5. Select**Microsoft Basic Display Adapter** from the list and click**Next** for the driver to be installed.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-37.png)
6. Your screen might flash a couple of times during the older driver installation, but no need to worry much about it, as it’s normal.
7. Repeat the same to install the generic display card driver for your other display card should you have one.

 Restart your computer to see if your computer screen remains black. If the problem remains, please move on.

### 1.2 Clean install the graphics card driver

 As mentioned, the screen goes black after installing a graphics card driver problem could be caused by a step going wrong during the display card driver installation process, like faulty driver files or incorrect permission granted. To see if this is your case, you can do the following to clean install the display card driver:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time, then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-22.png)

Then download and update the display card driver.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### 1.3 Run the hardware troubleshooter to see if it’s a hardware problem

 If you’ve already tried the above but your screen remains black, you may need to check if the problem is with your hardware devices: faulty power supply, motherboard, display cable (HDMI, DP, or VGA), and/or the graphics card itself could also cause a black screen problem.

 To see if this is your case, you can run the built-in hardware troubleshooter in this way:

1. Open the Run dialog by pressing**Windows + R** on your keyboard.
2. Type**`msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic`** into the box and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-11-troubleshooter-1.jpg)
3. When the troubleshooter window opens, click**Next** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-11-troubleshooter-2.jpg)
4. If any issues are found, follow the on-screen instructions to fix them.
5. If none are found, close the window and try the next fix below.

### 1.4 Restore BIOS settings

 Your monitor will remain black if there are some incorrect settings in BIOS, which stop certain firmware and/or software from starting properly. To see if this is your case, you can try to restore your BIOS settings to default.

 You can reset your BIOS settings back to it’s original to see if that’s the issue for you. Here is how to do it:

1. Press and hold the power button until your computer turns off.
2. Disconnect the AC power cord from the power supply, and then open your computer case.
3. On your motherboard, remove your CMOS battery with your fingernail or a non-conductive screwdriver. The CMOS battery looks like this:  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-38.png)
4. Wait for 5 minutes, and then reinstall your CMOS battery.
5. Connect the AC power cord to the power supply, and then turn on your computer to see if your problem persists.

### 2.2 Try different hardware devices

 At this point, if none of the above helps, you may need to consider different hardware devices, as it could be a problem with the graphics card, the hardware device itself, when it blacks out after a driver installation. As mentioned, faulty power supply, display cables, or motherboard could also be the culprit.

 If you’re not sure about this, you can always seek help from a hardware technician to see if they can run some tests on your hardware components to make sure that they’re still working fine.
