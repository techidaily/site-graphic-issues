## Control Panel Now Open for Modding

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/0.jpg)

 When you go into the NVIDIA Control Panel to change the settings, you see this message pop-up:**Access Denied Failed to apply selected setting to your system** . You’ll absolutely feel confused and upset. But don’t worry, this problem should be easy to fix. Try below methods to fix it.  

## Try these fixes

1. [Update your NVIDIA graphics driver](#m1)
2. [Reinstall your graphics driver](#m2)
3. [Run the NVIDIA Control Panel as administrator](#m3)
4. [Close Game Bar](#m4)

### Method 1: Update**your NVIDIA graphics driver**

 The “Access Denied” problem probably caused by an old, wrong or missing NVIDIA graphics driver. So you should verify that your graphics adapter has the correct driver, and update it if it doesn’t.  

 There are two ways you can update your NVIDIA graphics adapter:[manually](#o1) or [automatically](#o2) .

#### Option 1 – Download and install your driver manually

 NVIDIA keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[NVIDIA website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update your NVIDIA graphics driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your NVIDIA graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 If you encounter problems while using Driver Easy, please send an email to [support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

4) Run the NVIDIA Control Panel to check if this fixes your problem.

### Method 2: Reinstall your graphics driver

 If updating the driver can’t help you, you may need to reinstall it completely. There may be corrupted driver files that simple uninstallation can’t get rid of. You need to clear all the files before you install the new driver.

 1) Run Driver Easy and select**Tools** .

 2) Select **Driver Uninstall** . Click**Display adapters** folder and select your NVIDIA graphics driver. Then click the**Uninstall** button. Your graphics driver will be removed soon.
