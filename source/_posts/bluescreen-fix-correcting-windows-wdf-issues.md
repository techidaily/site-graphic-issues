## BlueScreen Fix: Correcting Windows WDF Issues

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_59100aa7daf8d.jpg)

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) fixes the WDF\_VIOLATION blue screen error in Windows 10 immediately!

**WDF\_VIOLATION** (with WDF standing for**Windows Driver Framework**)  in Windows 10 usually indicates that Windows found an error in a framework-based driver. It’s less likely that this error is caused by your hardware. As such, the resolutions to this problem are not that difficult to find.

 In this post, we will be showing you some of the effective methods to tackle the WDF\_VIOLATION blue screen of death problem on your Windows 10\. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one that works for you.

 Method 1:[**Update Device Drivers**](#m1)
 Method 2:[**Use Driver Verifier**](#m2)
 Method 3:**[Repair system files](#RE)**

**IMPORTANT:**  You’ll need to be logged into Windows on the problem computer to try any of these solutions. If you can’t log into Windows, power on and off your PC 3 times to perform a hard reboot and [restart it in Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , then try these solutions.

 Note that the screenshots in this post are captured from a Windows 11 operating system. If you are using Windows 10 or older versions, please be aware that the visual appearance of your screen may vary slightly, but the steps to perform the task remain consistent.

## 1: Update Device Drivers

 As mentioned, the WDF\_VIOLATION is usually caused by certain drivers, display or video drivers in most cases. Therefore, the easiest way is to update device drivers for your PC.

 There are two ways for you to get the right drivers for your devices: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update**  – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct driver. Note that you should always go to the PC manufacturer if you’re a laptop user.

**Automatic driver update**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your system, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you’re not ready to buy the Pro version, Driver Easy offers a 7-day free trial which includes access to all the Pro features such as high-speed download and one-click install. You won’t be charged anything until your 7-day trial has ended.)
