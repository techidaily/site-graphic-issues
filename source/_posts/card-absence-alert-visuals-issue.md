## What is Graphics Card and why this problem happens

 A Graphics card is referred to**video card** ,**video adapter** , and**display adapter** as well. It **connects to the motherboard of a computer system and generates output images** to display. If you want to watch movies or play games on your computer, a dedicated graphics card can greatly improve the quality of the graphics.

 1) Go to**Documents**  \>**My Games** .
