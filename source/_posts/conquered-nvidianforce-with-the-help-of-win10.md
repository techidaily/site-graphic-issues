Here are 3 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

 **Method 1:[Re-install LogMeIn Mirror Adapter](#m1) Method 2:[Clean Re-install Display Driver](#m2) Method 3:[Update Display Driver](#m3)**

But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee): 1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy. 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now**button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_58f0869bdce5d.png) 3) Click the**Update**button next to the flagged display card to automatically download and install the correct version of its driver (you can do this with the FREE version).
