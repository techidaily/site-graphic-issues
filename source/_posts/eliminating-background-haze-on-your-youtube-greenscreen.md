### Fix 1: Disable hardware acceleration

**Hardware Acceleration**  is a feature in  browsers  that tasks GPU with all the graphics and text rendering, hence giving you a better video playing and watching experience.

 But sometimes it’s also the culprit of this **green-screen-on-YouTube** issue. So you should disable hardware acceleration to see if it fixes the issue.

 Here is how to**disable hardware acceleration** in**Google Chrome** ,**Firefox** and**Microsoft Edge** :
