### Fix 2: Adjust your PC settings

 You can also tweak your system settings to make the best of your PC. Here’re the instructions on how to**limit the number of startup apps** ,**disable CPU Parking** ,**update your graphics driver:**

#### 1\. Limit the number of startup apps

 Apps that automatically run at startup can take up extra amounts time in the boot process. These background apps can also hog your CPU resource and network bandwidth. So you can remove them from your list of startup programs and hopefully reduce lags while playing Anthem.

Here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** at the same time to open Task Manager.

 2) Click and right-click on**the applications that you don’t want an auto-run on** and click**Disable** .

#### 2\. Disable CPU Core Parking

 Core parking is a utility in Windows that helps save power by scaling the number of logical processors in use based on the workload. If enabled, it can cause your CPU to be in a sleep state and decrease the performance of your CPU.

So you can follow the steps below to disable CPU core parking:

 1) On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type**msconfig** and press**Enter** .

 2) Click the **Boot** tab, select your **Windows system** , and click **Advanced options** …  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-34.png)

 3) Tick**the box** for**Number of processors** and choose**the maximum number of processors** . Then click**OK** .

 4) In the**System Configuration** window, click**OK** .

 5)**Make sure you’ve saved your work on your computer** and click**Restart** .
