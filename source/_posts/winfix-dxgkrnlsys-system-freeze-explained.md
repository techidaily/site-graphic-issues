## Fix 2\. Keep Windows 10 Updated

 It is always suggested that you keep your system updated so as to avoid any unwanted issues, like this one. So if you have not yet updated your Windows 10 just yet, do it now.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and**X** at the same time, then click **Settings** .

 4) If find any available update, just download them and wait for them to be installed. You may need to restart your computer for the change to take effect.

## Fix 3\. Update Graphics Card Driver (Recommended)

 As mentioned,**dxgkrnl.sys** stands for **DirectX Graphics Kernel.**  When you see an error code related to your video card, you should first consider updating your graphics card driver.

 You can search for the needed display card driver on the manufacturer website of your computer. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics card device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click_**Update All**_ ).

## Fix 4\. Check for Possible Hardware Failure

 We have seen some cases in which the problem was caused by a faulty motherboard or a RAM module. If you have tried the above methods and the error stays, you may need to take your PC to a repair store to get it checked.

 Before you take it to a repair store, you can try one last thing:**turn off NVIDIA surround**  if you are using a NVIDIA graphics card. Here is how:

 On your keyboard, press the combination keys**Ctrl + Alt + S** or**Ctrl + Alt + R** to turn it off.

 If the NVIDIA surround cannot be turned off in this way, you need to try booting with another monitor and it should be turned off automatically.
