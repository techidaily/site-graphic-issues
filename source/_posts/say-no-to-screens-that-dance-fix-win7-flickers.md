## Say No to Screens that Dance – Fix Win7 Flickers

 If your computer screen flickers frequently, it’s really annoying. But don’t worry, you can try the fixes below to solve the problem. They have worked for many Windows users.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Update your drivers](#f1)**
2. **[Check for hardware issues](#f2)**
3. **[If you use Adobe Flash and Java, uninstall them](#f3)**
4. **[Update your BIOS](#f4)**

### Fix 1: Update your drivers

 The screen of your Windows computer may flicker or blink frequently if your device drivers are faulty or outdated. You can update your device drivers, especially your graphics and chipset drivers, and see if this fixes your problem.

 There are two ways to update your graphics and chipset drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your drivers automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .

### Fix 2: Check for hardware issues

 It’s also possible that your screen flickering problem results from interference from outside or defective cable connection.

To troubleshoot these hardware issues:

1. Make sure that there is no **magnet** around your computer — magnetic field can make your screen blink.
2. You should also check if the **cables** are connected properly to your screen or monitor. You can gently swing your screen and see if it flickers. If it does, you need to reconnect those cables.

### Fix 3: If you use Adobe Flash and Java, uninstall them

 Applications like**Adobe Flash** and**Java** are also known to cause the computer screen to flicker. If you have these apps on your Windows 7 computer, uninstalling them may help fix your problem.

1. Click the**Start** button >**Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf27d890806d.jpg)
2. In the view of**Category** , under**Programs** , click**Uninstall a program** .

3. Select the app you want to uninstall.
4. Restart your Windows 7 computer and check if your screen flickering problem is resolved. If not, try Fix 4, below.

### Fix 4: Update your BIOS

 The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) on your computer manages the communication between your hardware and your operating system. It may cause your screen to flicker or blink if it’s outdated. You can try updating your BIOS to troubleshoot your screen flickering problem.

**IMPORTANT:** Be extra careful about updating your BIOS, and always back up your data before doing it. If you make a mistake or if an error occurs, your computer may become unusable and you may lose your data.

1. Go to**System Information** to get detailed information about your computer:  
   1. Type **msinfo32**  in the Windows search box and press**Enter** on your keyboard.  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b91080612181.png)  
   2. At System Information, you can view the information of your**System Manufacturer** and**System Model** .

5. When the download is finished, make sure your computer is plugged in, then double-click on the downloaded file.

 If you’re using**DELL** , press**F2** on your keyboard to access BIOS;  
 If you’re using**HP** , press**F10** or**F1** ;  
 If you’re using**Lenovo** , press**F1** ;  
 If you’re using**Toshiba** , press**F2** or**F12** ;

9. Just to be on the safe side, backup your BIOS: click the**Backup** or**Save** option or tab on the BIOS main screen, then follow the on-screen instructions.
10. According to the information you obtain in Step 5), enable and use your BIOS update tool to begin updating your BIOS.
