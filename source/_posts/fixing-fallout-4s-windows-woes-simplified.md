**Fallout 4 crashes on startup** and you don’t know what you’ve done to cause the problem? Don’t worry! There are solutions to fix the issue. This article introduces 5 easy ways to**fix the Fallout 4 crashing on startup** .

## Why is Fallout 4 crashing on startup?

 The reasons causing Fallout 4 crashing can be different, as some players have Fallout 4 crashing on loading, and some have Fallout 4 crashing after a few minutes. But generally speaking, the Fallout 4 crashes because of the video resolution, the graphics card issues or because of the hardware issues (ensure that **your computer meets the minimum requirements to play Fallout 4**).

## How to fix Fallout 4 crash on startup?

1. [**Install the latest patch**](#Way1)
2. [**Set the graphics options to low**](#Way5)
3. [**Update your graphics card driver**](#Way2)
4. [**Temporarily disable the antivirus program**](#Way3)
5. [**Configure settings in your Fallout 4**](#Way4)

 All the screenshots shown below are from Windows 10, but the fixes apply to Windows 8 and Windows 7.

### **1\. Install the latest patch**

 The bugs in the game can cause the crashing issue, and that’s why the developers keep releasing the latest updates for the game. The updates  contain important changes to improve the performance, stability and security of the applications that run on your computer. Installing them ensures that your **software**  continues to run safely and efficiently.

 Therefore, you should check the latest patch for Fallout 4 in your computer, and install the latest patch to keep your game up to date.

 After updating, restart your computer, and open Fallout 4 to see if the crashing issues have been fixed.

### **2\. Set the graphics options to low**

 As you may know, the video settings in your game can cause the Fallout 4 crashing in your Windows computer, so you should pay attention to the graphics settings in your Fallout 4 to fix the issue.

 You can set your Fallout 4 to**Windowed Mode** , and also tweak the video settings using the**lower** **settings** . This varies from computers and hardware and software combinations, so we won’t cover it here.

### **3\. Update your graphics card driver**

 The missing or outdated graphics card driver can cause Fallout 4 crashing, so you make sure that your video card and its driver both work correctly. There are two ways to update your graphics card driver: manually and automatically.

 You can update your drivers manually from the  manufacturer’s website, download the latest correct driver and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**   or the **Pro**   version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee**):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**   button next to a flagged graphics device to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the **FREE**   version). Then install it in your computer.

 Or click **Update All**   to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** ).
