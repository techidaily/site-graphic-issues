## What is Graphics Card and why this problem happens

 A Graphics card is referred to**video card** ,**video adapter** , and**display adapter** as well. It **connects to the motherboard of a computer system and generates output images** to display. If you want to watch movies or play games on your computer, a dedicated graphics card can greatly improve the quality of the graphics.

### Fix 1: Restart your PC

 Restarting your PC helps your PC to check through the system and automatically update your Windows, then the problem may be automatically resolved.

 1)**Restart** your PC.

 2) After restarting,**open** the game again and see if the problem is resolved.

 1) Go to**Documents**  \>**My Games** .
