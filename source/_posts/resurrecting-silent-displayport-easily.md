**DisplayPort** is a computer connection format that delivers high performance display feature. You can connect your computer to a monitor with a DisplayPort cable for better display. However, it is possible that you have run into an issue where your monitor**has no signal** when your devices are connected via DisplayPort. In this case, you need a good fix to solve your problem.

 The following are the methods that can help you easily fix your DisplayPort no signal issue:

 **1)[Check your DisplayPort connection](#a)**

 **2)[Restart and reconnect your devices](#b)**

 **3)[Update graphics driver](#c)**

 **4)[Test with another cable or device](#d)**

## 1) Check your DisplayPort connection

 You may not be aware, but usually the DisplayPort no signal issue comes from**improper connection** . You have to ensure that the connector has been plugged into the port correctly and it cannot be pulled out too easily.

 You can**unplug** an**re-plug** the DisplayPort connection. Try**pushing the connector further** until you feel the pointy bits on the plug lock it in so that it is difficult for you to pull it out.

## 2) Restart and reconnect your devices

 Restarting and reconnecting your devices is something that you should definitely give a try. It is a simple but sometimes effective way to fix the issue. To perform this method please follow the steps below.

**a)** **Completely turn off** your computer and monitor and unplug their power cables.

**b)** **Unplug** their DisplayPort connection.

**c) Leave**  them for**a couple of minutes** .

**d) Connect** the DisplayPort cable**back** to the computer and monitor.

**e) Plug** the power cables**back** and**power** the devices**on** .

If this fix is useful, your DisplayPort connection will work now.
