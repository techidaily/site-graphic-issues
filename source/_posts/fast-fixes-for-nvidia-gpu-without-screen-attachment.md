### Fix 1: Update your NVIDIA drivers (nearly always fixes the problem)

 This error message may occur if you’re using the wrong or outdated NVIDIA drivers. So you should update your NVIDIA drivers to see if it fixes the problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.
