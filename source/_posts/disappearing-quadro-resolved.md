**Note** : NVIDIA graphics card may not be shown as its own device name. It could be an unknown device, video controller, etc. If you are not sure how to identify it, just uninstall the device that has a yellow mark on it.

 6\. After uninstalling, restart your computer then Windows will reinstall the driver automatically.

### Method 2: Update the NVIDIA Graphics Driver

 If Method 1 doesn’t resolve the problem, it’s suggested that you update the driver to the latest version.

 You can go to NVIDIA’s official website to download the latest driver for your Graphics card. But if you don’t have time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 Here’s a step-by-step guide to automatically updating your NVIDIA driver with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Activate & Update** button next to a flagged NVIDIA graphics driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (Note: This will prompt an upgrade to the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy offers a 7-day trial period with access to premium features like high-speed downloads and one-click installations. You won’t be charged until the trial ends.)
