## Fixes for Unable to save display settings

2. [**Update your graphics driver**](#F2)

### Fix 1: Change your screen resolution

 There’s a good chance your graphics hardwares have been fighting among each other on which resolution to output, hence the**Unable to save display settings** error. If this is the case, you should make sure your screen resolution is set to**the lowest one** .

 So for example, if you have 3 monitors of resolutions, namely 1900 x 1200, 1600 x 900, 1280 x 800, then you should make sure you set the screen resolution to 1280 x 800 in order for a successful setup.

To do so:

1. Right-click on**any empty space** on your desktop and click**Screen resolution** .

2. In the**Resolution** section, click**the drop-down menu** and select**the lowest resolution of all the connected monitors** . Then click**Apply** \>**OK** .

3. Restart your computer and check if the **Unable to save display settings** issue has been fixed. If no, then move on to**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 This**Unable to save display settings** error may occur if you are using the wrong  graphics  driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your graphics driver  to see if it fixes your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
