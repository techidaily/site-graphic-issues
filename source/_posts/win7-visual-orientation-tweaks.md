### Fix 1: Restore your screen rotation with a keyboard shortcut

To change your screen rotation in your system display settings:

1. Right click an empty area of your desktop, then select**Screen resolution** .

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

You may have a screen upside down issue even if you didn’t do anything wrong. This is because your graphics driver is not working properly.
