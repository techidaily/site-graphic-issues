If you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and you find that your PC runs into a black screen, you’re not alone. Many Windows 10 users are reporting this problem. But no worries, it’s possible to fix. Here in this post, we provide you with 3 fixes. You don’t need to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.   **Method 1:[Unplug your external devices](#m1)**   **Method 2:[Reinstall display card driver](#m2)**   **Method 3:[Update display card driver](#m3)** **IMPORTANT:**  You’ll need to be logged into Windows on the problem computer to try any of these solutions. If you can’t log into Windows, power on and off your PC 3 times to perform a hard reboot and [restart it in Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , then try these solutions.

## 1\. Unplug your external devices

 Sometimes, your PC’s external devices can be the cause of the black screen problems, for example, when you have too many external devices plugged in. Unplug all your external devices and then plug them back on one by one. This helps you determine which device is causing the problem. Once you find out the faulty device, you need to contact its manufacturer and see if they can provide support.

## 2\. Reinstall display card driver

**Note**: You should do the uninstall in [**Safe Mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). Faulty display card drivers can be the cause of this problem as well. You can reinstall the correct display card driver to your system and get this problem solved: 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_5811a625cdad7.png) and**R**at the same time. Type **devmgmt.msc** and press **Enter**.

## 3\. Update display card driver

If the above method doesn’t help, you need to check if there is newer version of driver for you display card. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).

But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee): 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy. 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now**button.
