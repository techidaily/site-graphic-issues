### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 This problem may occur if you have the wrong or outdated graphics driver on your computer. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes the issue. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy.](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
