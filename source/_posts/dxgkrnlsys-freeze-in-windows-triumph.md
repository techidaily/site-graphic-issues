## Fix 3\. Update Graphics Card Driver (Recommended)

 As mentioned,**dxgkrnl.sys** stands for **DirectX Graphics Kernel.**  When you see an error code related to your video card, you should first consider updating your graphics card driver.

 You can search for the needed display card driver on the manufacturer website of your computer. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

## Fix 4\. Check for Possible Hardware Failure

 We have seen some cases in which the problem was caused by a faulty motherboard or a RAM module. If you have tried the above methods and the error stays, you may need to take your PC to a repair store to get it checked.

 Before you take it to a repair store, you can try one last thing:**turn off NVIDIA surround**  if you are using a NVIDIA graphics card. Here is how:

 On your keyboard, press the combination keys**Ctrl + Alt + S** or**Ctrl + Alt + R** to turn it off.

 If the NVIDIA surround cannot be turned off in this way, you need to try booting with another monitor and it should be turned off automatically.
