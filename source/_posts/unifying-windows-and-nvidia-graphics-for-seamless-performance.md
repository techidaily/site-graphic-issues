Here are 3 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

 **Method 1:[Re-install LogMeIn Mirror Adapter](#m1) Method 2:[Clean Re-install Display Driver](#m2) Method 3:[Update Display Driver](#m3)**

If the above method doesn’t work for you, you need to update your display card driver.

You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee): 1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy. 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now**button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_58f0869bdce5d.png) 3) Click the**Update**button next to the flagged display card to automatically download and install the correct version of its driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click**Update All**to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)– you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All). ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_58f0884f08079.jpg)
