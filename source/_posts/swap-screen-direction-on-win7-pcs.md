### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

You may have a screen upside down issue even if you didn’t do anything wrong. This is because your graphics driver is not working properly. You should try updating your graphics driver to see if this resolves your problem.

2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
