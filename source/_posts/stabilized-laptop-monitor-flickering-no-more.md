 If your laptop screen keeps flickering, you may try the steps below in any order to troubleshoot the problems.

**1.** The problem may be caused by the outdated driver. Try to update the graphics card driver to your computer.

**2.** Change the refresh rate to match the capabilities of your monitor.

 Right-click the desktop and choose**Screen Resolution** , then click**Advanced Settings** and**Monitor** . If enabled, place a check beside**Hide Modes That This Monitor Cannot Display** and choose a**higher refresh rate** from the list trying at 80 Hertz if possible.
