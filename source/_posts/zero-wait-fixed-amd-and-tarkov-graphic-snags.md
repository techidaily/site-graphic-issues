## Zero-Wait Fixed: AMD & Tarkov Graphic Snags

 These days, AMD graphics card users are pretty bummed when playing Escape from Tarkov. The game becomes unplayable when it’s raining. Everything is covered with shadows and black. If you’re on the same boat, don’t worry. In our article, we’ll show you effective methods to fix this graphics issue.

## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Verify integrity of game files](#fix1)**
2. **[Delete the game cache](#fix2)**
3. **[Clean your temp folder](#fix3)**
4. **[Update your graphics driver](#fix4)**
5. **[Repair your PC](#fix5)**

## 1\. Verify integrity of game files

 A variety of issues, including graphics glitches, can be caused by corrupted or missing game files. Therefore, you’ll need to perform an integrity check to resolve your problem. Follow the steps below to do so.

1. Open your game launcher.
2. Locate your profile. Then click on the drop-down and select**Integrity check** .

 This may take some minutes to redownload and reinstall any missing or corrupted game files.

 When the process is finished, relaunch your game and test the gameplay. If it’s still unplayable when it’s raining, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Delete the game cache

 Another great way to troubleshoot your issue is by clearing the cache. Temporary files and data are often stored. But over time, this cached data might become corrupted, which can lead to issues with connectivity, game freezes, slow or unsuccessful game loads, and other performance issues. In this situation, you’ll need to clear the cache from the EST launcher. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Open up your EFT launcher.
2. look in the top right where your profile picture is. Click on the drop-down next to it and select**Clear cache** .

 Then relaunch your game. If your problem persists, proceed to the next fix.

## 3\. Clean your temp folder

 Apart from clearing the game cache, you may want to clean the temp folder which stores temporary game files. This won’t cause any issues and instead, you’ll receive a performance boost.

1. Open up your launcher.
2. Locate your profile on the top right. Then click on the drop-down and select**Settings** .

3. Scroll down to the**Tem directory** section. Then click**Clean Temp folder** .

4. Select**Yes** .

 When it’s done, relaunch your game. If your problem persists, proceed to the next fix.

## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Next you would need to take a look at your graphics driver. Graphics glitches may be caused by your outdated graphics driver. If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your graphics driver, definitely do it right now. Doing so may help you fix your issue in no time.

 To update your graphics driver, you can do it manually by going to the official website [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) to download and install the exact driver for your system. Or you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## 5\. Repair your PC
