### Fix 1: Check your DirectX version and update it

 As the error message suggested you can, first of all, check the DirectX version on**your computer** to see if it meets the minimum requirement (DirectX 9.0c and later). If it’s older than the required version, you’ll need to**update and install the latest DirectX** in your Windows.

#### **How to check the DirectX version in Windows?**
