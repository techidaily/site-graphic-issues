## What is Microsoft Basic Render driver

 Microsoft Basic Render driver is the driver software for Microsoft Basic Display adapter, which provides your computer with the display and graphics capabilities when you don’t have the dedicated driver software installed for your graphics card.

 Usually Windows will use the graphics card driver installed officially for the video card in your computer. But if there’s something wrong with your dedicated graphics card driver, or if your computer chooses to use the Microsoft Basic display adapter, your system will use the Microsoft Basic display adapter instead of your own graphics card.

 To simply put, you can choose to use your dedicated graphics card and update your graphics card driver to fix your problems.

## Try these fixes

 Here are solutions you can try. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until everything’s working again.

1. [Enable your dedicated graphics card](#F1)
2. [Update your graphics card driver](#F2)

 Note: the screenshots below come from Windows 10, and fixes apply to Windows 8 and Windows 7.

### Fix 1: Enable your dedicated graphics card

 If your own graphics card has been disabled or corrupted, your computer will automatically choose to use the Microsoft Basic Display adapter for GPU, in order to maintain the routine process in your system. So you should make sure that your graphics card is in good condition, and then enable your dedicated graphics card for Windows.

Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b0b16974940.png)**  and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. In Device Manager, double click**Display adapters** to expand it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdc1be34535d.jpg)
3. Right click on your graphics card that you want to use, and click**Enable device** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdc1d6521b36.jpg)  
 If you don’t see Enable device in the context menu, but see**Disable device** , you can click**Disable device** , then click**Enable device** to re-enable your graphics card.
