## What is Direct3D and Why does the error happen?

 Direct3D, which belongs to a part of DirectX, is a**graphics application programming interface** for Windows, which is used to render**three-dimensional graphics** in applications or games like**Call of Duty** ,**Tomb Raider** , etc. Direct3D uses the hardware acceleration if it is available on the**graphics card** , and allows the hardware acceleration of the 3D rendering pipeline.

 Why does this problem happen? There are various reasons for this problem, and the possible causes can be the**old DirectX version** ,**the missing or outdated video drivers** , or**the missing DLL files** in your program file.

 As the error message suggested you can, first of all, check the DirectX version on**your computer** to see if it meets the minimum requirement (DirectX 9.0c and later). If it’s older than the required version, you’ll need to**update and install the latest DirectX** in your Windows.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics card driver

 Graphics card driver issues can cause the**failed to initialize Direct3D** issue. If the video driver in your computer is missing or out of date, it can result in this problem and stop running the application or game. So you should **update the graphics card driver** to fix the error.

 There are two ways to update the graphics drivers: manually and automatically.

**Manually update driver** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your graphics card, find the exact graphics card driver for your graphics adapter, and install it in your Windows.

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way. You need to know for sure the right driver online that matches your Windows OS, download it, and install it step by step.

**Automatically update driver** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics card driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 With Driver Easy, you don’t have to search and find what drivers are needed in your PC, nor to update drivers step by step. It can considerably help with almost all the issues related to drivers.

 Furthermore, you can update your graphics card drivers automatically with either the FREE or Pro version of Driver Easy.**It only takes 2 simple clicks with the Pro version** (and you will get full support and**a 30-day money-back guarantee**).

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
