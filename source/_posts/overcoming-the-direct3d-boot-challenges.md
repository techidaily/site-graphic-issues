### Fix 2: Update your graphics card driver

 Graphics card driver issues can cause the**failed to initialize Direct3D** issue. If the video driver in your computer is missing or out of date, it can result in this problem and stop running the application or game. So you should **update the graphics card driver** to fix the error.

 There are two ways to update the graphics drivers: manually and automatically.

**Manually update driver** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your graphics card, find the exact graphics card driver for your graphics adapter, and install it in your Windows.

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way. You need to know for sure the right driver online that matches your Windows OS, download it, and install it step by step.

**Automatically update driver** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics card driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 With Driver Easy, you don’t have to search and find what drivers are needed in your PC, nor to update drivers step by step. It can considerably help with almost all the issues related to drivers.
