 Another graphics card designed for gamers: AMD Radeon HD 6950 ensures “unbelievable performance and flawless graphics for uncompromising gamers.”
  
 To ensure that you have a better gaming experience, it is strongly recommended that you constantly keep your graphics card driver updated.
  
 In this post, we will show you three more effective ways to update your Radeon HD 6950 graphics card driver, saving you bunch of time and energy.  
  
[**Option One: Update driver from device manager**](#1)
[**Option Two: Update driver manually**](#2)
[**Option Three: Update driver automatically (Recommended)**](#3)
  
 **Option One: Update driver from device manager**
  
 You should always consider getting your device drivers updated from Device Manager first, since the safest way for you to update your drivers is via Windows driver database.

 1) Press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Device Manager** .
