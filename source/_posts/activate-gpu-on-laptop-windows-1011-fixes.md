### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 You need to find the model of your graphics card and visit the manufacturer’s website(**[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  , **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ). Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version. This needs some computer skills.

 After doing so, open Task Manager to check if the program is using the dedicated GPU.

If not, see below for more solutions.

## Fix 5: Make sure your dedicated GPU is enabled in BIOS

 If your laptop cannot detect your dedicated GPU, it won’t use it until you enable it directly from BIOS. To do so:

1. While your computer boots, keep pressing your BIOS key to enter BIOS. (The exact key to press depends on your laptop’s manufacturer, which could be F10, F2, F12, F1, or DEL)
2. Go to**Chipset** , and search for dedicated GPU Configuration.
3. Find the dedicated GPU feature and set it to**Enabled** .

Once done, restart your laptop and see if the issue is fixed.

If this trick doesn’t work for you, check out the last solution.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Update your BIOS

 If none of the fixes above help, you may need to take into account updating your BIOS. By updating your BIOS, your motherboard will provide support for new hardware, like your dedicated GPU.

 You can update your BIOS by going to the motherboard manufacturer’s website and downloading the latest BIOS version.

**Please note** : An incorrect BIOS update might cause serious problems. For detailed instructions on how to update your BIOS, you can take a look at our [handy guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or check your motherboard manual.
