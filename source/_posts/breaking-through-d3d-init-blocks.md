### Fix 1: Check your DirectX version and update it

 As the error message suggested you can, first of all, check the DirectX version on**your computer** to see if it meets the minimum requirement (DirectX 9.0c and later). If it’s older than the required version, you’ll need to**update and install the latest DirectX** in your Windows.

#### **How to check the DirectX version in Windows?**

 Follow the instructions below to check the DirectX version in your Windows:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b0b16974940.png)** **\+ R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type**dxdiag** and click**OK** .
