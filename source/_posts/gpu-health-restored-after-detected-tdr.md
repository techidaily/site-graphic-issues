### What you might concern…

 If you’re curious about**what TDR is** in the error ‘A TDR has been detected’, here’s the**answer** :

 Your Windows operating system attempts to detect situations in which your computer appears to be completely frozen and then attempts to dynamically recover from the frozen situations so that your desktop is able to respond again. This process of detection and recovery is so-called**TDR (Timeout Detection and Recovery)** .

 When you’re seeing the error saying “A TDR has been detected”,**probably the TDR timeout was exceeded** . Try the methods below…

### Method 1: Update your NVIDIA graphics driver

 This error could be caused by a bug related to your graphics card. NVIDIA keeps updating drivers and when it receives bugs usually there would be a fix in the future driver update. When you’re having the ‘A TDR has been detected’ error, we recommend **updating your NVIDIA graphics card driver to the latest version** .

 Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

Here’s how you can do it:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the Scan Now button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click**Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** which comes with **full support** and a **30-day money-back guarantee**  . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.) **Note:**  You can also do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 Once you update your graphics card driver, try to open your game application or Illustration to see if the error disappears.
