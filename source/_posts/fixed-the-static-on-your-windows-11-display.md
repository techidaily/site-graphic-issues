### Fix 1: Check your cables

 A loose or damaged monitor cable can cause your screen to flicker. Before you begin to troubleshoot the screen flickering issues, you should first check if your monitor cables are plugged in securely.

* Completely turn off your computer and monitor. Then**unplug your monitor cable** and**plug it back in properly** .
* If your monitor cable is damaged,**replace it with a new one** .

 Once you’ve confirmed that your cables are not the problem, move on to troubleshoot the driver issues.

### Fix 2: Update your display driver

 One common cause of screen flickering is a corrupted or outdated display driver. To see if that’s the case, you should update your display driver to the latest version.

There are mainly two ways to update your display driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your display drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) for your display adapters, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with Windows 11.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your display drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact display adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/scan.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation. No charges will occur until after your 7-day trial period ends.)  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3090-Ti-2.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](mailto:support@drivereasy.com) .**

 After updating your display driver, restart your device and check if the screen flickering issue is resolved or not.

If the issue remains, check out the next fix.

### Fix 3: Change the refresh rate

 The refresh rate of a display is the number of times per second that your monitor draws a new image. If your display refresh rate is not set properly, you may encounter screen flickering issues in Windows 11\. To fix it, you can change the refresh rate. Here’s how:

1. On your desktop,**right-click** an empty space and select**Display settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/win11-display-settings.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, scroll down the page and select**Advanced display** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/win11-advanced-display.jpg)
3. For**Choose a refresh rate** , select a different refresh rate.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/win11-choose-a-refresh-rate.jpg)

 If changing the refresh rate doesn’t solve your problem, you may consider updating or uninstalling incompatible apps.

### Fix 4: Update or uninstall incompatible apps

 The app developers often release updates to tackle compatibility issues with the new operating system. If your apps are still running in an old version, you may encounter a flickering screen on your Windows 11 PC. To fix the potential problem, you need to update all your apps to the latest version.

 If updating apps doesn’t solve your flickering issues, consider**uninstalling the recently installed apps** , as they may not be compatible with Windows 11 and can cause a flickering screen. To uninstall an app:

1. Click**Start** and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/win11-start-settings.jpg)
2. In the left panel, select**Apps** , then click**Installed apps** .

3. Scroll down the list and find the app you want to uninstall. Then click the**three dots icon** and select**Uninstall** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/win-11-apps-uninstalled.jpg)
4. Click**Uninstall** again to confirm your choice.

 After uninstalling the first app, restart your computer and check if the flickering issue is resolved or not. If it’s not, uninstall each app one by one until the screen flickering issue is fixed.

### Fix 5: Change Accent color and Background

 Just like Windows 10, there is an option in Windows 11 that allows your system to automatically select an accent color from your background. However, there are many reports that this option turns out to be a culprit of screen flickering. So you can follow these steps to disable it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** .
2. In the left panel, select**Personalization** , then click**Background** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/win11-personalization-background.jpg)
3. To**personalize your background** , select**Picture** or**Solid color** . (You should avoid using the**Slideshow** option, which might cause your screen to flicker.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/win11-picture.jpg)
4. Go back to**Personalization** window and select**Colors** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/win11-personalization-colors.jpg)
5. For**Accent color** , select**Manual** .

### Fix 6: Disable animation effects

 Some users reported that they fixed the screen flickering issue in Windows 11 by disabling animation effects. You can give this a try. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** .
2. In the left panel, select**Accessibility** , then click**Visual effects** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/win11-accessibility-visual-effects.jpg)

Check if you’re still facing a flickering screen.

If this fix doesn’t do the trick, try the next one below.

### Fix 7: Disable hardware acceleration

 The hardware acceleration feature is widely used to improve overall performance. But in some cases, it may also cause your screen to flicker. To fix the issue, you’ll need to disable hardware acceleration on your PC. Here’s how:

#### To disable hardware acceleration in Windows 11

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then type**regedit** and click**OK** .

2. In Registry Editor, navigate to**HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Avalon.Graphics** .
3. Under Avalon.Graphics, on the right pane, check to see if there is a key named**DisableHWAcceleration** .  

 If there is,**double-click** on it and change the**Value Data** from 0 to**1** . Click**OK** to save changes.  
 If there isn’t, right-click on empty space and select**New** \>**DWORD (32-bit) value** .

4. Close Registry Editor and restart your computer.

 If the flickering issue occurs while using your browser, you’ll need to disable hardware acceleration in your browser as well. Here we’ll take Google Chrome for example.

#### To disable hardware acceleration in Google Chrome

1. On your computer, open Google Chrome.
2. At the top right, click the**vertical three dots** icon and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chrome-settings.jpg)
