## Fix 1: Ensure your compatible video cable is firmly connected

 A loose connection between your monitor and your PC will trigger the monitor’s no-signal issue. If you’re seeing the no signal message on your screen when your Windows system is running, the first thing you should check is whether your compatible video cable is firmly connected or not.

 If your compatible video cable is firmly connected but this issue persists, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Check if you selected the correct input source

 If you don’t select the correct input source for your monitor, you’ll also get the no signal issue. Before you select the correct input source for your monitor, you need to know what ports your PC and the monitor have.

 Follow the instructions below to select the correct input source for your monitor:

1. Ensure your PC and your monitor are both turned on.
2. Press the**menu** button on the edge of your monitor.
3. Navigate to**Input Source** and select the correct input source. For example, if you connect your monitor to the VGA port on your PC, then set the input source as VGA.

See if this issue reappears. If not, you have fixed this problem!

## Fix 3: Check if your graphics card is firmly inserted in its slot

 You will also get the no signal message if your graphics card is not firmly inserted in its slot. In this case, you need to open your computer case to check. Here is how to do it:

 1)**Turn off** your computer, then **disconnect** all the cables (including your **power cord**) and the attached devices from your computer.

2) Open your computer case to locate your graphics card.

 The exact location of the graphics card depends on the type of card on your computer. If you’re not sure, please consult your PC manufacturer for assistance.

 3) Remove your graphics card from your motherboard and then **insert it firmly** in its slot.

 4) Plug **the power cable of your monitor** back in and connect it to your PC.

 5) Hold the power button down for **30 seconds to a minute** and then connect your power cord back and turn it on.

 See if this issue persists. If you still get the no signal message on your screen, don’t worry! There are more fixes for you to try.

## Fix 4: Test with another cable or PC

 The monitor no signal issue is also probably caused by**a damaged video cable** . Therefore, you can try connecting your monitor and your PC with another cable to see if this issue persists. If your monitor can get the signal now, the issue was caused by your video cable.

 But if the issue remains, try connecting your monitor to another PC. If your monitor still shows the no signal message, it could be the monitor that causes this issue. In this case, you should contact the manufacturer of your monitor for further assistance.

## Fix 5: Update your graphics driver

 Sometimes the monitor no signal issue may also result from faulty and incompatible graphics drivers. Try updating your graphics driver to see if you can resolve this issue.

 In this case, you’ll need to use another computer to establish a remote desktop connection to the problematic computer. If you’re unable to establish a remote desktop connection, you may need to contact your graphics card manufacturer for assistance.

There are two ways to update your graphics driver: **manually**  and **automatically** .

### 1\. Update your graphics driver manually

 You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card.

 Be sure to choose the driver that is compatible with your Windows system.
