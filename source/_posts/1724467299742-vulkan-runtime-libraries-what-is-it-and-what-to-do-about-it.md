## **What to do with Vulkan Run Time Libraries?** 

 As mentioned, you don’t need to do anything about **Vulkan Run Time Libraries** . It’s not a malware nor a virus, rather, it’s the new graphics PAR render with a simpler, thinner driver, and efficient CPU multi-threading capabilities. 

 You should know that not all games use Vulkan, and if you’re sure that no games in your PC use Vulkan, you may uninstall it as you like. 

 But note that Vulkan Run Time Libraries cannot be manually installed after you remove it from your operating system. You need to install the most recent version of the graphics adapter driver which ships with Vulkan to get it back.
