 1) Go to**Documents**  \>**My Games** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e84801ddcd1.png)

2) Click the file named after your game (like Terraria)

 3) Right click the**config.dat** file, click**delete** , and click**Yes** . (Please don’t worry. This will not affect your game. And it will download the Config.dat file again when you play it.)
