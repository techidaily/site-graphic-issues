### Method 1: Check your screen refresh rate

1. Right-click an empty area of your desktop and click**Display settings** . (If you’re on**Windows 7 or 8** , click**Screen resolution**)

3. If you’re on**Windows 10** , click the**Display adapter properties** for your monitor. (Skip this step if you’re using another Windows system.)

5. Click**OK** .
Hopefully, this fixes your monitor flickering issue. But if not, there are three more fixes you can try…

### Method 2: Update your graphics driver

The flickering issues may occur because you’re using a wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. You should update your graphics driver to see if this resolves your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . **Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.  You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee**):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7e74986a8bc.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to your graphics adapter to download the latest and correct drivers for them, then you can manually install it. You can also click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7e74fc5c7b0.jpg)  
 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### Method 4: Check for hardware issues

If your monitor is still flickering, it’s likely there are hardware issues with your video cable or your monitor itself. In this case, there are a few things you need to do: First, replace the**cable**you use to connect your monitor and your computer with a new one. This will resolve any problems you might be experiencing due to your cable. If changing the cable doesn’t work for you,**try your monitor on another computer**to see if the issue still occurs. If there are problems with your monitor, you should get them repaired or replaced.
