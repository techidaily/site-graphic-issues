 Before you get started, it is recommended that you back up the registry, so you can restore it if any problem occurs. See [How to Back Up and Restore Registry](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
  
 Follow these steps to add the registry keys:

 2\. Type**regedit** in the run box then click**OK** button. Then the “Registry” Editor will open.
