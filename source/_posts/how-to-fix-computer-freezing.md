 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and **Pause**  at the same time. Once in**System** , click**Advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf5450a7d020.jpg)
2. In the**Advanced** tab, click**Settings…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf5457e7b16c.jpg)
3. Click the**Advanced** tab and click**Change…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf545f9d7b67.jpg)
4. Make sure the**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** checkbox is**un-ticked** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf54672efc63.jpg)
5. Select**your windows drive** (the hard drive or partition that has Windows installed on it – usually **C:**), then click**Custom size** and enter an**Initial size** and**Maximum size** for your virtual memory:  
   * **Initial size** – This value varies, depending on your computer. If you’re not sure what value to use, just enter whatever the number is in the **Recommended** category.  
   * **Maximum size** – Don’t set this value too high. It should be about 1.5 times the size of your physical RAM. e.g. A PC with 16 GB (16384 MB) of RAM should have no more than about 16384 MB virtual memory (16384 MB x 1.5).  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf54940b3eb7.jpg)  Once you’ve entered your virtual memory values, click **Set** , then click **OK**  to continue.
6. Check to see if your computer freezing problem has been fixed. If not, then move on to**Fix 6** , below.

## Fix 6: Run Windows Memory Diagnostic

 This problem may occur when you have a failing or faulty RAM sticks. Luckily there’s a built-in tool called Windows Memory Diagnostic to help you run memory tests to check if you have bad RAM. To do so:

 **Make sure you’ve saved and close all your work on your computer** before running Windows Memory Diagnostic since your PC will be forced a restart to apply the changes.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** . Then type   **mdsched.exe** and press **Enter**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf668d3264af.png)
2. Make sure **you’ve saved and closed all the work**  on your computer and click   **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)**  if you want Windows to do a diagnostic test **NOW**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf668df89794.jpg)
3. By default,  Windows will boot into**the Standard test mode \***  . Wait the whole process to finish while Windows runs the diagnostic test.  
**\*** : There are three test modes in**Windows Memory Diagnostic** :**Basic** ,**Standard** and**extended** . You can press**F1** to check exactly what tests each test module includes, press**the arrow keys** to navigate among the test modes and press**F10** to start the memory test you select.
4. Once Windows reboots, check if you get an error report in the notification area:  
   * If you get a**No memory errors were detected from** **Windows Memory Diagnostic** message , then you can exclude bad memory as the root of the problem. Move on to Fix 6 for further troubleshooting.  
   * If you get a**report of memory errors**  , then you might have to narrow down until you find the exact faulty memory stick and have it repaired to see if it fixes the computer freezing issue.
