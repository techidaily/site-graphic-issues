## Fix 5: Adjust your virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf5450a7d020.jpg)
2. In the**Advanced** tab, click**Settings…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf5457e7b16c.jpg)
3. Click the**Advanced** tab and click**Change…** .

   * **Initial size** – This value varies, depending on your computer. If you’re not sure what value to use, just enter whatever the number is in the **Recommended** category.  
   * **Maximum size** – Don’t set this value too high. It should be about 1.5 times the size of your physical RAM. e.g. A PC with 16 GB (16384 MB) of RAM should have no more than about 16384 MB virtual memory (16384 MB x 1.5).  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf54940b3eb7.jpg)  Once you’ve entered your virtual memory values, click **Set** , then click **OK**  to continue.
