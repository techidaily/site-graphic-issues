## Simple Solution: Wake Up Your DP Connection

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59daecb8d2b72.png)

**DisplayPort** is a computer connection format that delivers high performance display feature. You can connect your computer to a monitor with a DisplayPort cable for better display. However, it is possible that you have run into an issue where your monitor**has no signal** when your devices are connected via DisplayPort. In this case, you need a good fix to solve your problem.

 The following are the methods that can help you easily fix your DisplayPort no signal issue:

 **1)[Check your DisplayPort connection](#a)**

 **2)[Restart and reconnect your devices](#b)**

 **3)[Update graphics driver](#c)**

 **4)[Test with another cable or device](#d)**

## 1) Check your DisplayPort connection

 You may not be aware, but usually the DisplayPort no signal issue comes from**improper connection** . You have to ensure that the connector has been plugged into the port correctly and it cannot be pulled out too easily.

 You can**unplug** an**re-plug** the DisplayPort connection. Try**pushing the connector further** until you feel the pointy bits on the plug lock it in so that it is difficult for you to pull it out.

## 2) Restart and reconnect your devices

 Restarting and reconnecting your devices is something that you should definitely give a try. It is a simple but sometimes effective way to fix the issue. To perform this method please follow the steps below.

**a)** **Completely turn off** your computer and monitor and unplug their power cables.

**b)** **Unplug** their DisplayPort connection.

**c) Leave**  them for**a couple of minutes** .

**d) Connect** the DisplayPort cable**back** to the computer and monitor.

**e) Plug** the power cables**back** and**power** the devices**on** .

If this fix is useful, your DisplayPort connection will work now.

## 3) Update graphics driver

 Sometimes the DisplayPort no signal issue may result from**faulty and incompatible graphics driver** . You should**update the driver** of your graphics adapter to fix problems of this kind.

## 4) Test with another cable or device

 Your Display no signal problem may be a**hardware issue** . You can test your DisplayPort connection with**another DisplayPort cable** or even with**another computer or monitor** . Check and see if the trouble comes from the cable or from the ports.

 If it is your computer or your monitor that is causing trouble, and if they are under warranty, you can contact the**manufacturers of your devices** for further assistance. They can help you identify the cause of your problem, and have your devices repaired or replaced.
