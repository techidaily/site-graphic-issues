 The following are the methods that can help you easily fix your DisplayPort no signal issue:

 **1)[Check your DisplayPort connection](#a)**

 **3)[Update graphics driver](#c)**

 **4)[Test with another cable or device](#d)**

## 1) Check your DisplayPort connection

 You may not be aware, but usually the DisplayPort no signal issue comes from**improper connection** . You have to ensure that the connector has been plugged into the port correctly and it cannot be pulled out too easily.

 You can**unplug** an**re-plug** the DisplayPort connection. Try**pushing the connector further** until you feel the pointy bits on the plug lock it in so that it is difficult for you to pull it out.
