## Diagnose & Repair: Computer's Non-Detection of VGA

 Can’t see your display card (aka video card, GPU, and graphics card) on your computer? Don’t worry, it doesn’t necessarily mean that your GPU is at fault, the problem could be simply on the settings front. Here in this post, we have some troubleshooting methods to fix the PC not detecting GPU problem for you. Read on and see what you can do to fix the problem.

## Try these fixes for the PC not detecting the GPU issue

 You don’t have to try all the following methods: just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick to fix the GPU not detected issue on your computer for you.

1. **[Add your GPU as a legacy device](#m1)**
2. **[Update the GPU driver](#m2)**
3. **[Restore your BIOS settings to default](#m3)**
4. **[Repair damaged or corrupted system files](#m4)**
5. **[Make sure your GPU is correctly seated](#m5)**

## 1\. Add your GPU as a legacy device

 When your computer does not detect your GPU, you can try to add it back as a legacy device to see if it helps. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time, then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-22.png)
2. Click to select your user name (**the first line**), then click**Action** on the menu bar and select**Add legacy hardware** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-8.png)
3. Click**Next** to move on.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-10.png)
4. Select **Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced)** and click**Next** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-11.png)
5. Select**Display adpaters** and click**Next** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-12.png)
6. Select**Microsoft** , and**Microsoft Display Adapter** on the right side panel. Then click**Next** and follow the on-screen instructions for the device to be added.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-9.png)

 When the GPU is added back, do the following to update its driver in Device Manager:

1. Double-click the expand**Display adapters** , then right-click the**Microsoft Remote Display Adapter** that you just added back and select**Update device** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-14.png)
2. Click**Search automatically for drivers** , Windows will then initiate a search online for the latest driver update. Follow any additional instructions provided during the driver update process.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-15.png)
3. When the driver update is done, restart your computer for the change to take effect.

 If no driver update is found by Windows for you, please move on to the next step to update the GPU driver.

## 2\. Update the GPU driver

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your GPU driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

## 3\. Restore your BIOS settings to default

 If you’ve previously overclocked your GPU, or you made certain changes in the BIOS, your PC might not detect your GPU either. To see if this is your case, you can try to restore your BIOS settings to default.

 The exact ways of restoring the BIOS settings to default vary for different motherboard manufacturers. Here are instructional posts from some of the most popular motherboard manufactureres. Click to see the instructions for your computer:

* [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025368/processors.html)
* [Dell](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fkbdoc%2Fen-us%2F000124377%2Fhow-to-perform-a-bios-or-cmos-reset-and-clear-the-nvram-on-dell-systems)
* [HP](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-reset-bios-settings-on-windows-pcs)
* [ASUS](https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1030210/#:~:text=the%20power%20cord.-,After%20reconnecting%20the%20power%20and%20booting%2C%20press%20and%20hold%20the,enter%20the%20BIOS%20to%20reset.&text=2.,return%20to%20the%20default%20value.)
* [MSI](https://www.msi.com/support/technical%5Fdetails/NB%5FBoot%5FOS%5FEntry#txt03)
* [ASRock](https://www.asrock.com/support/BIOSIG.asp?cat=BIOS9#:~:text=After%20the%20system%20restarts%2C%20press,exit%20the%20BIOS%20setup%20utility.)
* [Acer](https://community.acer.com/en/kb/articles/98-reset-bios-or-uefi-to-default-settings)

 If your motherboard is not listed above, you’ll need to go to the support page for your computer and see if you can find the correct instructions on the computer manual.

 If restoring your BIOS settings to default still don’t help to make your PC detect your GPU, please move on.

## 5\. Make sure your GPU is correctly seated

 If the above software-related troubleshooting procedures don’t help your PC to detect your GPU, you may need to look at the hardware front. One of the most obvious ways to looks at would be the graphics card itself.

 To make sure that the GPU is correctly seated in the correct PCIe slot, you can check its status in Task Manager like this:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**taskmgr** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-taskmgr.jpg)
3. Select**Performance** (the second icon).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-16.png)
4. If the**GPU** option is available, you should see the information about your computer’s GPU on the right side panel.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-18.png)
5. When you can see such information, your GPU should be correctly seated.
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453721/17020" target="_top" id="1453721"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453721" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453721/17020" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 But there are still possbilities that your GPU can be detected by your computer but is not correctly seated, so you may also want to check your computer case to make sure that your GPU is not lossen or wrongly inserted into the PCIe slots.

## Final thoughts

 If none of the above helps to resove the PC not detecting GPU issue for you, you may need to see if the GPU itself is at fault. If you don’t have enough time or energy to run such hardware tests, you can seek help from a hardware technician, and they’ll usually have some professional tools, which are more efficient in diagnosting hardware issues.
