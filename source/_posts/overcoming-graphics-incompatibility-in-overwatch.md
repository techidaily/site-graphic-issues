## Overcoming Graphics Incompatibility in Overwatch

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_591408431b0ab.png)

 When you are trying to play Overwatch, if you receive error message “**No compatible graphics hardware was found. (0xE0070150)** “, you can use methods below to fix the problem. Apply to Windows 10, 7, 8 & 8.1.

 **Method 1: Make sure you have the display cable plugged into the external graphics card**

 The error would occur if the game is trying to use the integrated graphics card but not the external graphics card. So make sure you have the display cable plugged into the external graphics card and not the motherboard.

 **Method 2: Reinstall the game to C:\\ drive**

 If the game is not installed on C:\\ drive, you can try reinstalling it to C:\\ drive. This method has worked for some other players who were experiencing the same issue as you. Try it and it may work like a charm for you.

 **Method 3: Update the graphics card drivers**

 Updating the graphics card drivers may resolve the issue. You can download the new drivers from the graphics card manufacturer’s website (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, etc.).

 Usually, the downloaded driver file is in .exe format. You can double-click on the downloaded file to install the driver. If updating the driver in this way doesn’t fix the error, you may need to install the driver step by step. Follow steps below to manually install the driver.

1\. Unzip the downloaded driver file to a specific location.

 2\. Open [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
