![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5be016dc3a765.jpg)

 If you encounter the **NVIDIA Display settings are not available. You are not currently using a display attached to an NVIDIA GPU** error message when opening **NVIDIA Control Panel** , don’t panic. It’s often quite easy to fix…

## Fixes for You are not currently using a display attached to an NVIDIA GPU

 There are 3 fixes that have helped other users resolve the problem in**Windows 10** ,**8.1** and**7** . Just work your way down the list until the problem is resolved.

1. [**Update your NVIDIA drivers (nearly always fixes the problem)**](#F1)
2. [**Reinstall your NVIDIA driver**](#F2)
3. [**Check if your monitor is plugged into the NVidia GPU port**](#F3)

### Fix 1: Update your NVIDIA drivers (nearly always fixes the problem)

 This error message may occur if you’re using the wrong or outdated NVIDIA drivers. So you should update your NVIDIA drivers to see if it fixes the problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. C  lick **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

 You can also click**Update** to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual
4. **Restart** your PC and check if **NVIADIA control panel** opens without fail. If it does, then congrats. But if the error still pops up, then move on to**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Reinstall your NVIDIA driver

It’s also possible that your current NVIDIA  driver is corrupted or in conflict with your Windows system and triggers the   **You are not currently using a display attached to an NVIDIA GPU** error message. We can try uninstalling the driver before reinstalling it to see if it fixes the problem.

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press  **the Windows logo key**  and   **R**  at the same time, then type **devmgmt.msc** into the box and press **Enter** .

2. Locate and double-click on  **Display adapters**  (aka.  **Graphics card** , **Video card**). Then right-click on **your NVIDIA product** right below and click **Uninstall device** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5be14ec2c9c6b.jpg)
3. Click **Yes** to confirm the uninstall.
4. **Restart**   your computer.
5. On your keyboard, press  **the Windows logo key**  and   **R**  at the same time, then type **devmgmt.msc** into the box and press **Enter** .

6. Click**Action** \>**Scan for hardware changes** so that Windows can reinstall the driver for your PC (a generic one though).

7. Check if**NVIDIA Control Panel** opens fine this time.

### Fix 3: Check if your monitor is plugged into the NVidia GPU port

 If the fixes above didn’t help solve the error, then you might want to check the back of your PC to see if the monitor is plugged into the NVIDIA GPU port. Be sure to leave it with professional hands if you’re not comfortable playing around with computer hardwares.
