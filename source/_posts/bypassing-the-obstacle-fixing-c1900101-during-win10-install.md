## Method 1: Update device drivers, esp. the display card driver

As the rest of the error message shows, the 0xC1900101 error is very likely to be caused by outdated device drivers, outdated display card driver, for specific. So one of the first things you do when you see the error code is to update all the available device drivers. **Manual drivers update**– Y ou can update needed drivers via the Device Manager one by one, or go to your computer’s manufacturer support website and search for the device drivers by yourself. Note that you should always go to the manufacturer website for your graphics card driver if you’re a laptop user. Because display driver from chipset or hardware manufacturer won’t have the customized features for your laptop. **Automatic drivers update**   – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it: 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy. 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged display driver to automatically download and install the correct version (you can do this with the **FREE** version). Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [**Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) version which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

4) When the update finishes, restart your computer as instructed. Check to see if the 0xC1900101 error is gone after this.

## Method 2: Uninstall third-party antivirus programs

 This error is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)  If this resolves the problem, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or remove it from your computer. In fact, if you’re already on Windows 10, we recommend that you don’t install any third-party antivirus program, because the built-in Windows Defender is powerful enough for you already.

## Method 3: Remove unused SAT devices

**IMPORTANT**: Please make sure that you don’t actually need the about-to-be-removed device. If you can’t decide whether to keep it or not, you should move on to the next method instead. 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key**and**R**at the same time. Type**devmgmt.msc**in and press**Enter**.

2) Double-click**IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers**. Right-click the SATA device you see here and click**Uninstall device**.

3) Tick the box for**Delete the driver software for this device**and click**Uninstall**.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a42025a54b53.png)

4) Restart your computer. Check if the 0xC1900101 error is gone now.

## Method 4: Do a clean boot

Clean boot requires only the very basic and built-in drivers and programs to run your computer. Therefore, it usually tells if the installed software is conflicting with others when you update, install or run it. If you’re having the 0xC1900101 error code, we recommend that you do a clean boot and see if you’re able to upgrade to or update your Windows 10 from there. **IMPORTANT**: You must log in as**administrator**to do the clean boot. 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key**and**R**at the same time. Type**msconfig**in and press**Enter**.

2) Click the**Services**tab, tick the box for**Hide all Microsoft services**. Then click**Disable**all.

You’ll see all the ticked boxes are empty after you click the Disable all button. 3) Click**Startup**, and**Open Task Manager**.

4) Click the programs you don’t want to start your PC with, and click**Disable**.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a41f91987269.jpg)

5) Close the Task Manager window, and go back to the System Configuration window. Click**Apply**and**OK**to save the changes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a41fd5bee675.png)

6) Restart your computer. 7) Check if the 0xC1900101 error disappears after the clean reboot.

## Method 5: Run SFC/ DISM tools

In some cases, the 0xC1900101 error could mean that your system files are somehow corrupted or broken, and the code is there to remind you that you may need to revert your PC to a more stable stage before you do the system upgrade or update. To fix it: 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key**. Type**cmd**in the search box. Right-click**Command Prompt**and click**Run as administrator**.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a420a4db13ec.png)

When prompted with the UAC, hit **Yes**  to continue. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img_586ca13144fd3.jpg) 2) In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste in the following command:

sfc /scannow

Press the **Enter**key on your keyboard.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a420bd11333c.png)

3) Wait for the process to finish. 4) In the same window, copy and paste in the following command:

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a420dc53a080.png)

5) When the scan finishes, restart your computer, and try the update or upgrade again to see if the 0xC1900101 error is gone.

## Method 6: Update BIOS

If you have tried all the methods above but the problem remains unsolved, it’s time for you to consider updating your BIOS. If you’re not sure how to do that, go to the manufacturer website of your computer and search for the specific instructions. To avoid any unwanted issues to your computer, you should always go to the manufacturer website for your PC to get your BIOS updated. Please DO NOT download BIOS from any third-party websites or products.
