 When you open NVIDIA control panel, if you get error message “NVIDIA Display settings are not available. You are not currently using a display attached to an NVIDIA GPU”, don’t worry. You can use the top 2 methods here to fix the error.

## **Top Method 1: Plug the monitor into the correct port**

 The error may occur if the monitor was plugged into the wrong port. So ensure the monitor is plugged into the correct port.

**Tip:** If you have more than one port, plug the cable to other ports and see if the problem resolves.

## **Top Method 2: Reinstall the NVIDIA graphics driver**

 You can go to NVIDIA’s website to check for and download the latest graphics card driver that you need.

 If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually,  you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to a flagged Nvidia driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

 Here take NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 for example. Driver Easy will detect the graphics card driver installed on your computer.
