 If you get error “**No AMD graphics driver is installed** ” after installing AMD Graphics drivers, don’t worry. You can fix the problem by following the instructions in this article.

 Go to [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and expand the branch “Display adapters”. You’re likely to see the AMD Graphics device listed with a yellow mark, which indicates the AMD Graphics driver is not installed successfully.
