 Many NVIDIA graphics adapter users have reported that their **[NVIDIA Control Panel](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is missing on their Windows computer. They can’t find the NVIDIA Control Panel on the desktop context menu or in the Windows Control Panel.

 You may be very annoyed when you‘re experiencing this issue. But don’t worry.**It’s fixable.** Here are a few fixes you should try.

4. When you’re sure that Nvidia Control Panel is installed, but it still missing on your desktop context menu, please move on to the fixes below.

## Method 2: Unhide your NVIDIA Control Panel

 Your NVIDIA Control Panel may be hidden by Windows during the upgrade from a previous version or by software that has accidentally changed the graphics settings. You can open NVIDIA Control Panel in Windows Control Panel and then show it in your desktop context menu. To do so:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run dialog. Type “_**control**_ ” in the Run dialog and press**Enter** on your keyboard. This will open Control Panel (of Windows).

5. Right-click your desktop and see if your NVIDIA control panel reappears in the desktop context menu.

## Method 3: Update your graphics driver

 If the methods above can’t help you, or you can’t see NVIDIA Control Panel even in Windows Control Panel, you need to update your graphics driver. In most cases, NVIDIA Control Panel disappears because you are using the wrong graphics driver or it is out of date. So you should verify that your graphics adapter has the correct driver, and update it if it doesn’t.

There are two ways you can update your graphicsdriver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](#option1")** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 NVIDIA keeps updating drivers. To get your NVIDIA graphics driver, you need to go to the **[NVIDIA website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## Method 4: Reinstall your graphics driver

 If updating driver can’t help you, you may need to reinstall it completely. There may be corrupted driver files that simple uninstallation can’t get rid of. You need to clear all the files before you install the new driver.

 To do a clean reinstallation of the display card driver, you can try DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller):

1. Download and search for the execution file of the display card driver from the website of your GPU manufacturer:  
   * **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  
   * **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  
   * **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**
2. Download DDU from the [**official download page**](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) . Then unzip the folder, and double-click the**DDU** file to further extract the execution file.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-3.png)
3. Boot your computer into Safe Mode as instructed here:[**Start Safe Mode using the System Configuration tool**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
