 No worries, it’s very easy to fix. Here are 3 solutions for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

**[1\. Turn on Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1](#m1)**
[**2. Update Intel Graphics Card Driver (Recommended)**](#m2)
[**3. Clean Reinstall Intel Graphics Card Driver**](#m3)

## 1\. Turn on Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1

 One of the reasons for this error message could be ill-functioned**.NET Framework 3.5** . You can turn it on to see if the problem is resolved:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59bf762c2349f.png) and**S** at the same time. Type**turn windows** then click**Turn Windows feature on or off** .

3) Restart your computer. See if the problem is resolved.

4) If not, you need to go to Microsoft support website to download **[.NET Framewor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21) [k](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21) [3.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21)** [](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21) . Then install it again. See if the same problem stays still.

## 2\. Update Intel Graphics Card Driver (Recommended)

 If turning on .NET Framework 3.5 fails to solve this problem for you, the cause can be outdated or missing Intel Graphics card driver. You can update the Intel driver to the latest version to see if the problem is fixed.

 You can do so via Windows Updates or Device Manager. Or you can search for the correct display driver on Intel support website by yourself.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
