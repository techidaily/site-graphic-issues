![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gpu-1.jpg)

 Facing the issue of your laptop not using a dedicated GPU such as Nvidia or AMD? This can be very annoying when playing a video game. But the good news is that it can be fixed easily. In this post, we will tell you some tricks to fix this problem.

 Before you begin to try the fixes below, make sure your laptop is connected to the power supply.

## Fixes for laptop GPU not being used

 You don’t need to try them all. Just walk your way from the top down until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Update your graphics driver](#Fix1)**
2. **[Install all Windows updates](#Fix2)**
3. [**Switch to the dedicated GPU manually**](#Fix3)
4. **[Change the Windows Graphics Settings](#Fix4)**
5. **[Make sure your dedicated GPU is enabled in BIOS](#Fix5)**
6. **[Update your BIOS](#Fix6)**

## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 When you’re facing the issue of your laptop not using a dedicated GPU, updating the graphics driver should be your go-to option since a faulty or outdated graphics driver can cause many problems. So always make sure you have the latest correct graphics driver for your operating system at all times.

 There are two ways you can try to update your graphics driver:**[manually](#Option1)** and**[automatically](#Option2)** .

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 You need to find the model of your graphics card and visit the manufacturer’s website(**[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  , **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ). Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version. This needs some computer skills.

Now you can check if your dedicated GPU is being used.

If this method doesn’t help, continue with the next fix below.

## Fix 3: Switch to the dedicated GPU manually

 Usually, your laptop will use the integrated GPU for easier tasks to save power and switch back to the dedicated GPU for better performance. But if it doesn’t switch to the dedicated GPU when needed, you can do it manually via NVIDIA Control Panel or AMD Radeon Settings.

### Switch to the dedicated NVIDIA GPU

1. Right-click your desktop background and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** from the menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
2. In the left panel, click**Manage 3D Settings** , then select**High performance NVIDIA processor** from the dropdown menu and click**Apply** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/manage-3d-settings.jpg)
3. In the left panel, click**Set PhysX Configuration** . Under Select a PhysX processor, select your dedicated GPU from the dropdown menu, then click**Apply** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/set-phx-configuration.jpg)

Your laptop should now run with the dedicated NVIDIA GPU.

### Switch to the dedicated AMD GPU

1. Right-click your desktop and select**AMD** **Radeon Settings** from the menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amdradeon-settings.jpg)
2. Navigate to the**System** tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amd-system.jpg)
3. Select**Switchable Graphics** . This view lists recent and current running applications.

4. Select a program and choose**High performance** from the drop-down menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amd-highperformance.jpg)
5. Running the program again.

It should now run with the dedicated AMD GPU.

But if not, you can take a look at the next fix.

## Fix 4: Change the Windows graphics setting

 Another way to force your laptop to use the dedicated GPU is by changing the Graphics settings. To do so:

### Windows 10

1. Right-click your desktop and select**Display Settings** from the menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/display-settings-1.jpg)
2. In Display settings, scroll down the page and click**Graphics settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/graphics-settings-1.jpg)
3. Click**Browse** and select the executable file of the program you want to use the dedicated GPU.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/browse-1.jpg)
4. Then click**Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/options-1.jpg)
5. In the pop-up window, select**High performance** and click**Save** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/high-performance-1-1.jpg)

### Windows 11

1. Right-click on the empty space on your desktop. Then select**Display settings** .  

![win11 - Display settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/win11-Display-settings.jpg)
2. Scroll down. Under the Related settings section, click on**Graphics** .  

![Windows 11 - Change graphics preference](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/win11-Display-settings-Graphics.jpg)
3. Click**Browse** and select the executable file of the program you want to use the dedicated GPU.  

![Windows 11 - Change graphics preference](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/win11-Display-settings-Graphics-Custom-options-for-apps.jpg)
4. Once added, click on the**Options** button.  

![Windows 11 - Change graphics preference](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/win11-Display-settings-Graphics-Options.jpg)
5. In the pop-up window, select**High performance** and click**Save** .  

![Windows 11 - Change graphics preference](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/win11-Graphics-preference-High-performance.jpg)

 After doing so, open Task Manager to check if the program is using the dedicated GPU.

If not, see below for more solutions.

## Fix 5: Make sure your dedicated GPU is enabled in BIOS

 If your laptop cannot detect your dedicated GPU, it won’t use it until you enable it directly from BIOS. To do so:

1. While your computer boots, keep pressing your BIOS key to enter BIOS. (The exact key to press depends on your laptop’s manufacturer, which could be F10, F2, F12, F1, or DEL)
2. Go to**Chipset** , and search for dedicated GPU Configuration.
3. Find the dedicated GPU feature and set it to**Enabled** .

Once done, restart your laptop and see if the issue is fixed.

If this trick doesn’t work for you, check out the last solution.

## Fix 6: Update your BIOS

 If none of the fixes above help, you may need to take into account updating your BIOS. By updating your BIOS, your motherboard will provide support for new hardware, like your dedicated GPU.

 You can update your BIOS by going to the motherboard manufacturer’s website and downloading the latest BIOS version.

**Please note** : An incorrect BIOS update might cause serious problems. For detailed instructions on how to update your BIOS, you can take a look at our [handy guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or check your motherboard manual.
