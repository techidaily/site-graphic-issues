### Fix 1: Restore your screen rotation with a keyboard shortcut

This should change your screen orientation back to the normal one. If this didn’t work for you, you may need to try changing your screen rotation in your display settings.

### Fix 2: Restore your screen rotation in your display settings

To change your screen rotation in your system display settings:

1. Right click an empty area of your desktop, then select**Screen resolution** .

3. Click**OK** .
This should restore your screen orientation. If not, or if you want to prevent this issue from happening again, you may need to try the method below.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

You may have a screen upside down issue even if you didn’t do anything wrong. This is because your graphics driver is not working properly. You should try updating your graphics driver to see if this resolves your problem.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to_your graphics adapter_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install the driver.
