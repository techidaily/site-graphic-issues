## Fixed the Flashing Problems for Good

 Many computer users have reported problems with their monitor. What usually happens is the screen or the LED light of their monitor**keeps blinking** . If you’re experiencing this problem, don’t worry. You’re not the only one… and you should be able to fix the problem quite easily using one of the solutions we’ve listed below.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you:

1. [**Restore your monitor to the factory defaults**](#a)
2. [**Update your graphics driver**](#b)
3. [**Troubleshoot hardware issues**](#c)

### Fix 1: Restore your monitor to the factory defaults

 Perhaps your monitor is blinking because the settings on your monitor are not correct. Try**restoring your monitor to the factory defaults** and see if this fixes your issues.

 You may need to consult the**manual** of your monitor for instructions on how to factory reset your monitor.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 You may be experiencing the monitor blinking issues because you are using a wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. In this case, you should update your graphics driver. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee**):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7e74534ce8f.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to_your graphics card_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install it. You can also click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

### Fix 3: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If your monitor is still blinking, it’s likely there are hardware issues with your**monitor** , your**cable** or you**computer** . In this case, there are a few things you need to do:

1. Replace your**video cable** with a**new one** . This will resolve any problems you might be experiencing due to your cable.
2. Try using another**video port** to connect your monitor to resolve the problems due to your port.
3. Try using your monitor**on another computer** to see if there are issues with your computer.

 If there are problems with any of your devices, you should get them repaired or replaced.
