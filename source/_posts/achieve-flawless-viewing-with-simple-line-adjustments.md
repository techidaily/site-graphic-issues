### Fix 3: Gently wipe the screen with cotton balls

 If the fixes above didn’t help with the problem, then it’s most likely a hardware problem. You can power off the computer and then gently wipe across the screen with cotton balls.**Be sure to proceed with caution** so as not to cause any further damage to your laptop.
